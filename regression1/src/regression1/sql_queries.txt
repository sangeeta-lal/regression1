update  chromium_combined_score_table set sim_score = title_log_ngram_sim+ desc_log_ngram_sim + title_change_path_sim+ cr_area_top_level_change_path_sim 

update  chromium_combined_score_table set size_score = is_bug_fix + changed_path_count+lines_added+
lines_deleted+ lines_changed + chunks_added+chunks_deleted +chunks_modified+max_dev_in_file+max_change_count +avg_rev_comitter_expr 

update  chromium_combined_score_table set combined_score =  size_score + sim_score
